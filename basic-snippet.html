    <h1>Today we're going to break down what is happening in the below line</h1>
    <p>
      Want to search the web?
      Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
    </p>

    <p>First, we will look at what the code is for the above example.
      <xmp>
        <p>
            Want to search the web?
            Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
        </p> </xmp>

        Let's break it down as to what each of these mean. The 'p' tag stands for paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" id="p-tag" class="p_tag"  target="_blank">Here's a link to learn more</a>! Additionally, the p tag has a start and end to the tag. If you look at the end of the lines above, you will see <xmp><p> </p> </xmp> enclosing the code above. the '/p' tag signifies that the p tag has finished and so nothing else within there will be affected by that tag.<br><br>
        So, within this 'p' tag we have our text which is a child of the p tag. Additionally, there is another child object in the 'a' tag. This 'a' tag is used to create hyperlinks, or a way to redirect you from the current website to another one. I will use an 'a' tag here in order to link a page to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" id="a-tag" class="a_tag"  target="_blank"> learn more</a>!
        This 'a' tag has a few different attributes to it. The 'href' attribute is where the link that you are redirecting goes. The 'id' and 'class' tag have to do with css and styling of the page. These allow the css file linked to look at the html page and apply specific styles to a given id or class. An 'id' can only apply to one element but a class can apply to multiple that's why the id has the more specific name. The 'target' attribute shows where the linked document will open when the link is clicked. Since ours reads target="_blank" , the linked document will open in a new tab.
