    <h1> This is a page that will show that I am capable of creating html pages</h1>
    <p> I think that the most important skill here is really to be able to
      follow instructions. However, the hard part of it is being able ot read
      instructions while also creating a web page. This is why I use two screens
      and computers as a way of getting some good dual screen aciton. As a way
      to make sure that there is content in these pages, I'm going to use an AI
      to generate content. This is what I got: <br>
      I have to make a web page so I used AI to write for me. I want it to have
      many options.I want to add a custom background color for the text.
      I want to choose text colors. But, for now I just want it to be really
      big and it should work fine on mobile. It is really hard to make it
      look decent.The problem I am having is that when the page is set to mobile
      size the font is too big and it looks really bad.
    <h2>More AI Generated Content</h2>
